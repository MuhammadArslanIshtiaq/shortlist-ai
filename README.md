# Shortlist AI: A Serverless AI-Powered Recruitment Platform

Shortlist AI is a cloud-native, serverless recruitment platform designed to help HR teams automatically rank and shortlist job applicants using intelligent matching. Built on AWS Lambda and Amazon Bedrock, it combines semantic AI and a robust serverless backend to evaluate resumes against job descriptions with precision, speed, and scalability.

## üîß Backend Setup Overview

The entire backend was built manually in the AWS Management Console to ensure a deep understanding of each service's configuration. All resources were deployed in the `us-west-2` region.

### IAM (Identity and Access Management)

- A central IAM Role (`ShortlistAILambdaRole`) was created for all Lambda functions to use
- A comprehensive IAM Policy (`ShortlistAILambdaPolicy`) was attached to this role, granting granular, least-privilege permissions for all required actions across DynamoDB, S3, Bedrock, Textract, SNS, and API Gateway
- A separate `TextractServiceRole` was created with a specific trust policy allowing the Textract service to assume it and publish notifications to SNS on our behalf

### DynamoDB

- Four NoSQL tables were created to manage the application's state: `Jobs`, `Applicants`, `WebSocketConnections`, and `TextractJobs`
- A Global Secondary Index (GSI) was added to the Applicants table to allow for efficient querying of all candidates for a specific job

### Amazon S3

- Two private S3 buckets were created: one for storing job description files and another for securely storing applicant resumes
- The resumes bucket was configured with a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy to allow direct, secure file uploads from the frontend application

### Amazon Cognito

- A Cognito User Pool was set up to manage secure authentication for the HR admin dashboard
- It was configured to use email as the username and a public app client suitable for a web-based frontend

### API Gateway

- A REST API was built to handle all standard data requests from the frontend, with routes like `/jobs`, `/applicants`, and `/status` integrated with their corresponding Lambda functions
- A separate WebSocket API was created to manage real-time, persistent connections for the notification system, with routes like `$connect`, `$disconnect`, and `ping` linked to their own handler Lambdas

### SNS (Simple Notification Service)

- An SNS topic named `TextractCompletionTopic` was created to act as a messaging bus, decoupling the text extraction process from the AI analysis process
- Its access policy was configured to allow the Textract service to publish messages to it

### AWS Lambda Functions:

- A suite of single-purpose functions were created to handle all backend logic. Each is triggered by a specific event source (API Gateway, S3, or SNS).

- REST API Handlers: createJob, listJobs, getJobDetails, updateJob, deleteJob, submitApplication, listAllApplicants, getResumeDownloadUrl, updateApplicantStatus.

- Asynchronous Workflow: processResume (triggered by S3) and processAnalysis (triggered by SNS).

- WebSocket Handlers: handleSocketConnect, handleSocketDisconnect, and handlePing.

## üß† The Core Role of AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is the central nervous system of the Shortlist AI application. It is the core service that powers every piece of business logic, data processing, and real-time communication. Our application leverages Lambda in multiple, distinct ways, each triggered by a different event source.

### The Asynchronous AI Analysis Workflow: A Journey of a Resume

The most critical process in our application is the AI analysis pipeline. This workflow is a perfect example of an event-driven architecture orchestrated by AWS Lambda.

#### Trigger 1: S3 Object Creation
When a candidate uploads their resume, it triggers our first Lambda function, `processResume`.

#### Lambda 1: processResume (The Orchestrator)
This function starts a complex, asynchronous process by initiating an AWS Textract job and creating a mapping record in DynamoDB.

#### Trigger 2: SNS Topic Notification
After Textract finishes, it publishes a message to an Amazon SNS topic, which in turn triggers our second Lambda, `processAnalysis`.

#### Lambda 2: processAnalysis (The Analyst)
This function is the AI brain. It gets the extracted text, constructs a detailed prompt, calls Amazon Bedrock for analysis, and updates the applicant's record in DynamoDB with the AI-generated score and feedback.

### The API Backbone: REST and WebSocket APIs

#### REST API Lambdas (via API Gateway)
A suite of single-purpose Lambda functions (`createJob`, `getJobDetails`, etc.) are triggered by API Gateway to handle all standard data operations for the dashboard.

#### WebSocket API Lambdas (via API Gateway)
- `handleSocketConnect` & `handleSocketDisconnect`: Manage the lifecycle of real-time connections
- Other Lambdas, like `submitApplication` and `processAnalysis`, push notifications through this WebSocket API to all connected clients

In summary, AWS Lambda is the fundamental compute service that enables the event-driven, scalable, and cost-effective architecture of Shortlist AI.
